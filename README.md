# About

`browse-assist` is shared class project for [CS544](https://blogs.ubc.ca/cpsc544/home/) in the University of British Columbia for HCI course. This project showcase a concept prototype of improved browsing feature inside file explorer of Windows 10.

For the sake of simplicity, the scope of this project is to showcase the proposed interaction design with the file explorers, therefore, we have implemented it in a fake explorer simulated in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
