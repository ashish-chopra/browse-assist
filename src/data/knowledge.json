The reality is that delivering force feedback in informal settings and diverse environments suffers from linked constraints. Producing force requires physical grounding, which limits workspace size; meanwhile, expansion impacts affordability and application versatility.",

One strategy to reduce the risk of violence is prevention focused education. The purpose of this paper was to report the learning outcomes of a workplace violence educational prevention program tailored to the needs of emergency department employees. A quasi-experimental design was used to determine the knowledge retention of program content following a hybrid (online and classroom) educational intervention. One hundred twenty emergency department employees that completed the workplace violence prevention program participated in the study. A repeated-measures analysis of variance was conducted to determine if individual test scores increased significantly between baseline, posttest, and six month posttest periods. The results indicated a significant time effect, Wilk’s L 1⁄4 .390, F (2, 118) 1⁄4 26.554, p < .001, h2 1⁄4 .310. Follow-up polynomial contrasts indicated a significant linear effect with means increasing over time, F (1, 119) 1⁄4 53.454, p < .001, h2 1⁄4 .310, while individual test scores became significantly higher over time. It was concluded that the use of a hybrid modality increases the probability that significant learning outcomes and retention will be achieved.",

            "abstract": "Sociological and technical difficulties, such as a lack of informal encounters, can make it difficult for new members of noncollocated software development teams to learn from their more experienced colleagues. To address this situation, we have developed a tool, named Hipikat, that provides developers with efficient and effective access to the group memory for a software development project that is implicitly formed by all of the artifacts produced during the development. This project memory is built automatically with little or no change to existing work practices. After describing the Hipikat tool, we present two studies investigating Hipikat’s usefulness in software modification tasks. One study evaluated the usefulness of Hipikat’s recommendations on a sample of 20 modification tasks performed on the Eclipse Java IDE during the development of release 2.1 of the Eclipse software. We describe the study, present quantitative measures of Hipikat’s performance, and describe in detail three cases that illustrate a range of issues that we have identified in the results. In the other study, we evaluated whether software developers who are new to a project can benefit from the artifacts that Hipikat recommends from the project memory. We describe the study, present qualitative observations, and suggest implications of using project memory as a learning aid for project newcomers.",

After a total of 85 hours of on-the-job observation, we report on the common abilities evidenced by new software developers including how to program, how to write design specifications, and evidence of persistence strategies for problem- solving. We also classify some of the common ways new software developers were observed getting stuck: communication, collaboration, technical, cognition, and orientation. We report on some common misconceptions of new developers which often frustrate them and hinder them in their jobs, and conclude with recommendations to align Computer Science curricula with the observed needs of new professional developers.",

            "abstract": "It is often assumed that developers’ view of their system and its environment is always consistent with everyone else’s; in practice, this assumption can be false, as the developer has little practical control over changes to the environments in which their code will be deployed. To proactively respond to such situations, developers must constantly monitor a flood of information involving changes to the deployment environ- ments; unfortunately, the vast majority of this information is irrelevant to the individual developer, and its sheer volume makes it likely that infrequent change events of relevance are overlooked. As a result, errors may arise at deployment time that the developer does not immediately detect. This paper presents a recommendation approach for filter- ing the flood of change events on deployment dependencies to those that are most likely to cause problems for the indi- vidual developer. The approach is evaluated for its ability to drastically filter irrelevant details, while being unlikely to filter important ones. The relevance of the results is as- sessed on the basis of deployment problems that would have historically occurred within a set of industrial systems.",

Simple statistical analyses of the data first reveal robust power-law behavior for package, method call, and lexical containment distributions.
